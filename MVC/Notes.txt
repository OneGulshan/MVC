Notes in MVC
-------------

use this in Package Manager Console if project not works.
Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r

DataAnnotations in MVC
-----------------------
[Required]//Default Message
[Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is mandatory")]//Custom Message
[RegularExpression(@"(?=^.{8,}$)((?=.*\d)|(?=.*\W+))(?![.\n])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z]).*$", ErrorMessage = "UpperCase, LowerCase, Numbers, Symbols, 8 Characters")]//@ <- Verbatim Litteral For Esscape Sequences reading as a normal character like \d etc.
[DataType(DataType.Password)]//DataType Only Works With EditorFor
[ReadOnly(true)]//We can't overwrite/insert data here(because Model not Accepted here), so maked field readonly also on View
//Note:- Every DataAnotation its own Default Message but we can declare own Custom Message also using by ErrorMessage.
//if auto required message showed other prop's without data anotation appling please provide null by ? that's prop.
//Required DataAnnotations is must For Performing Other DataAnnotations
<p>@Html.LabelFor(m => m.EmployeeId) &nbsp; @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.EmployeeId, "", new { @class = "form-control" })</p>//form-control <- bootstrap control
@Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.EmployeeId, "", new { @class = "text-danger" })//"" <- No Name of ValidationMessageFor(must declare so, declare empty name)
<p>@Html.LabelFor(m => m.EmpPassword) &nbsp; @Html.EditorFor(m => m.EmpPassword, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = "form-control" } })</p>//htmlAttributes is the syntax with EditorFor, With EditorFor Bootstrap Worked Automatically
<p>@Html.LabelFor(m => m.EmpOrganisationName) &nbsp; @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.EmpOrganisationName, new { @Value = "ABC Organisation", @readonly = true })</p>//Value/readonly is the TextBox Attribute


 29.Entity Framework
 --------------------
 Note:- Before we using Ado.Net Classes for Accessing Data from DB in Applications. Now we used EF for Data Accessing using Entity and Models using ORM.
 EF is the type of ORM(Object Releational Mapping) Tool, used For Mapping for Accessing data from Entities and Models. EF works with EDM(Entity Data Model).
 EDM perform Relationships bet Entities(DB Table).
 Diff Bet ADO.Net and EF?
 ADO.Net is an Automated mechanism and EF used Linq for retriving and manipulating data as strongly type objects.

 EF diff approaches to manage data related to apps :- Code First, DataBase First, Model First Approaches.

30. EF Code First Approach
 ---------------------------
 Model to DB approach <- Its a most common approach
 Note:- DbSet for Models set to DB, Keep ConnectionString name same as DataContext class name.
 return View(db.Employees.ToList());//Entity(DB Table) use on View using Model
 ModelState.Clear();//No Req When we redirect to others View

 Steps:- Install EF, Model, DataContext, ConnectionString(provideName is must), Create Controller, Create View(Manualy).

 31. Creating Crud Application using EF Code First Approach
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 TempData vs ViewBag in C#?
 TempData is used for sending data from Same Controller's Action View to Other Action View/Other Controller's Action View. But If we Want to Show Message on Same Controller's View then we use ViewBag.
 @Html.Raw(ViewData["ErrorMessage"])@*For Reading Raw Data of script as a alert*@

 Implement jqGrid in MVC C#
 ---------------------------
 https://youtu.be/Hpt4Ew4ySZk <- Learned jqGrid From Here
 http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6 <- Download jqGrid Link
 Steps:- Extract File In Folder -> add ui.jqgrid in Content folder -> Create a jqGrid Folder in Scripts Folder and add grid.locale-en.js and jquery.jqGrid.js files in it.
 https://jqueryui.com/download/ <- Now download Redmond theme from here
 Steps:- Extract File In Folder -> Add a Theme Folder in Content Folder and add jquery-ui.min.css file in it. Create another images folder in Content directory and add all images in it.
 Now, add all files in Index View for showing jqGrid, like jquery-ui.min.css and ui.jqgrid.css for UI. grid.locale-en.js and jquery.jqGrid.js files for working on jqgrid.
 $grid = $("#jqGrid").jqGrid({ //Calling by jqGrid function using jqGrid here
 url: '../Home/GetData', /*'@Url.Action("GetData", "Home")', <- In js file this not worked*/
 Notes :- Using single Action Method Showed jqGrid and Strongly Typed Entities Both on View.
 pager property in jqGrid For adding pager in jqGrid, by default each page contains 20 rows in each page. using rowNum property we can change page size.
 rowList for using dropdown for changing page size. viewrecords property for sawing number of record in jqGrid as a label.
 height & width for increasing height & width of jqGrid.
 - For Changing jqGrid Theme move on https://jqueryui.com/download download any theme del Content images and jquery-ui.min.css files and replace by new theme files that's it.
 - For Clearing Browser Data cnt+h, clear browsing data. cached images and files, clear data.
 - Replace Low Quality Icons with Hight Quality Icons in jqGrid.
